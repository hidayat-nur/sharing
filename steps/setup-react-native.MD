### To set up React Native with the command-line interface (CLI), you'll need to follow these general steps:
1. Install the React Native CLI by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
yarn global add react-native-cli
```
or
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```
> This will install the React Native command-line interface globally on your system.

<br/>
<br/>

2. Create a new React Native project by running the following command:
```
react-native init MyProject
```
> This will create a new project named "MyProject" in a directory with the same name.

<br/>
<br/>

3. Navigate to the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:
```
cd MyProject
```

<br/>
<br/>

4. In another terminal or command prompt, run the following command to launch the app on the emulator or physical device:
- For Android: 
```
react-native run-android
```
- For iOS:
```
react-native run-ios
```
